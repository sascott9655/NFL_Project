    "NFL Project -> Extracted data from the espn website APIs. Use this github for api extraction:  Thank you by the way! Finding out what team_stats contribute most to winning. Definitely will answer more questions and give high-level interpretation of the data. Data is extracted for NFL season 2025 (regular season games only). Graphs and visualization will be implemented to clearly show the stats that contribute most to winning and maybe help NFL teams build better football teams for future seasons! Thanks for supporting and any further questions or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!"

On the other hand a team like the Cleveland Browns relied heavily on their defense to win games as when they won and averaged a mere 13 first downs a game and averaged more first downs in their loss games with 17 first downs. On these stats alone we can roughly see what side of the ball the teams relied on for victories. The Chiefs reliant on their offense only won 6 games this season and the Browns reliant on their defense only won 5 games this season. So is offense more important than defense? Or vice versa? This question will be address further in the notebook. "

    "According to the eye test correlation it does seem to be that making more plays generally results in football teams winning more games. However there are some outliers. For instance the Dallas Cowboys were by far and away the team that averaged the most plays per game, however it resulted in only winning 7 games. This could mean that the Cowboys could be a team that perform really well on offense and were not such a good defensive football team. Maybe it could be that the plays they made were less efficient on offense than some other teams. This is why we will explore the stat ypp to see if this reasoning is valid. Other outliers were Philadelphia Eagles with 11 wins and low play per game rate (only around 59 plays per game) and the New York Giants with 4 wins but nearly average 64 plays per game."
