    "NFL Project -> Extracted data from the espn website APIs. Use this github for api extraction:  Thank you by the way! Finding out what team_stats contribute most to winning. Definitely will answer more questions and give high-level interpretation of the data. Data is extracted for NFL season 2025 (regular season games only). Graphs and visualization will be implemented to clearly show the stats that contribute most to winning and maybe help NFL teams build better football teams for future seasons! Thanks for supporting and any further questions or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!"
